this script makes it easy to record tempo-locked loops in stereo (using softcut) as well as mix in free-running supercollider engines.

the cityscape is full of towers - building them up or down modulates the sounds coming from the city. 

cities are all alike and all different. like cities, this script welcomes changes. the engine is simply a collection supercollider tweets - you can [easily find more](https://twitter.com/search?q=SinOsc%20(%23supercollider%20OR%20%23sc%20OR%20%23sctweet)&src=typed_query&f=live). once you remove/add an engine, you can change the [modulators in the main script]().
