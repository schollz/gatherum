## gatherum

a omnium-gatherum of norns ideas / single purpose scripts. 

I've been learning norns + supercollider through making these scripts. they all work, but maybe that have a limited scope / purpose. I continue to find these useful for my own learning / musical journey, and maybe they might find use for someone else.

current scripts:

- <kbd>br</kbd>: sample-based noisy chaotic breakbeat created using the `Breakcore` UGen. ([demo](https://www.instagram.com/p/COqOS5lBGDL/))
- <kbd>brbr</kbd>: sample-based chaotic breakbeat engine using my sample engine + `Task` (possibly less noisy than `br`) ([demo](https://www.instagram.com/p/COsjGK_hjZ7/))
- <kbd>brbrbr</kbd>: live-input breakcore engine (add fx maybe too?) ([demo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CO6FYwGhEKz/))
- <kbd>kalimba</kbd>: a kalimba follower for Am-tuned kalimba

use these as-is. or play with them. change them. install them, delete them. break them. unbreak them. make them something else. make them your own. the lua scripts are all small (<100 lines) and straightforward. the engines may be interesting starting points or ending points for something.
