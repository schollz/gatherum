# gatherum

a omnium-gatherum of norns ideas / single purpose scripts.

currently:

- `br`: sample-based noisy chaotic breakbeat created using the `Breakcore` UGen.
- `brbr`: sample-based chaotic breakbeat engine using my sample engine + `Task` (possibly less noisy than `br`)
- `brbrbr`: live-input breakcore engine (add fx maybe too?)

use these as-is. or play with them. change them. install them, delete them. the lua scripts are all small (<50 lines) and straightforward. the engines may be interesting starting points or ending points for something.
